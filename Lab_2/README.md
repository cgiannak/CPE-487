For lab 2, I used what I learned from part 2 of lab 1 to make a functioning clock that counted in Hex on the NEXYS 4 DDR board. Although creating the bitstream was mostly the same as in lab 1, lab 2 helped introduce how to use implemented design, as well as the memory configuration file. Once I had a four digit Hex counter that worked, I went back into Vivado to implement the modifications, in this case to turn the 4 digit counter into and 8 digit counter. For this modification, the process was the same as the 4 digit counter, just using different files. After finishing this lab, although I don't understand how the internal clock or refresh period works, I do understand what the counter is doing from a surface level.
